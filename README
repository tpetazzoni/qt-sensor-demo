This is a demo application written as part of a series of blog posts
demonstrating how to build a Linux system, with a Qt5 application
reading and displaying sensor data, for the STM32MP157 Discovery
board.

Do not take this application as good example of Qt5 programming: its
developer is an embedded Linux developer with limited Qt5
knowledge. It is really a demo-quality application.
